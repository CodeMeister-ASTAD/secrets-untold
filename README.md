A security library for storing and retrieving credentials for apps running on Windows.

This work is based on work I have done in the past for storing and retriving encrypted credentials. 
It is based on the early ASP.Net credential storage for web applications. 
It is Windows specific since it uses the registry and the DPAPI. 
I might add saving/retreiving from a file so it will be able to be used cross plattform.
